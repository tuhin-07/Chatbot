You can see or download the current securities list from the table below. Yes, we allow buying and selling of scrips under ASM and GSM, owing to certain rules and regulations. At Angel, trading is allowed in ASM scrips, while in the case of GSM, only scrips categorised under 0 and 1 are allowed for trading. To safeguard the clients from undue loss arising due to monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities such as insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more, particular scrip and scrips are blocked from trading. The applicable margin while placing orders for ASM/GSM scrip will be 100% in all stages while the price band fluctuates. For GSM: In Stage 1, the applicable margin shall be 100%, while, from Stage 2 onwards, an Additional Surveillance Deposit of 50% or 100% will be applicable based on GSM stage. Note: Please know that clients will not be able to buy stocks that are in stage 2 of GSM or higher. These stocks will require Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of 100% of the trade value or more and this margin will remain blocked by the exchange atleast for 2 months even after the stock is solid. No, trading in unsolicited scrips is restricted at Angel One.Click hereto know more unsolicited investment tips. Insolvency Bankruptcy Code (IBC):This law is incorporated to handle insolvency and bankruptcy cases. When a stock is under surveillance for IBC, it means the company is going through an insolvency procedure. For some of these stocks, trading may still be allowed subject to the stage of surveillance. Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA):An agreement between various lenders and a single borrower that describes their rights and obligations in case of a default is ICA. When a company has entered into ICA to restructure the debt, its stock comes under the surveillance. In these cases, trading in the stocks might be allowed but with certain restrictions in place. Trading is resticted for certain scrips to protect clients from undue loss arising due to liquid counters. If the client has bought SME shares through IPO, selling is allowed. However, buying is completely blocked as per the risk and management decision to safeguard clients from undue losses occuring due to liquid counters. Buying/selling is limited to a particular quantity due to illiquid counters and dry volumes. This restriction also safeguards clients from excess losses. This criteria is removed from Angel One.

Surveillance Measure is an initative by the regulatory bodies and exchanges to protect traders and investors by monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities like insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more. SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) along with the stock exchanges have initiated an Additional Surveillance Measure or ASM to safeguard investors\u2019 interests by ensuring there are no market speculations or manipulations like unexpected price movements. The stocks are categorized under ASM for surveillance based on criteria specified by NSEhere. GSM or Graded Surveillance Measure is a system used by Indian Stock Exchanges like NSE and BSE to alert traders/investors and ask them to be extra cautious while dealing in certain securities which have been categorized under GSM. Scrips can be classified under GSM due to abnormal price hike that doesn\u2019t match with the company\u2019s financial health, are illiquid, have negligible market capital, and are underpreforming. The main aim of the ASM framework is to control stock volatility, while the primary objective of GSM is to protect the investors from underperforming stocks by not allowing intraday trading and to advise them to be extra vigilant while dealing with securities that are witnessing unusual price fluctuations. Both these frameworks are introduced with different objectives, but their main goal is to protect traders and investors. SEBI and Exchanges jointly decides the objective criterion to shortlist securities under ASM based on the following parameters:1. High Low Variation2. Client Concentration3. Close to Close Price Variation4. Market Capitalization5. Volume Variation6. Delivery Percentage7. No. of Unique PANs & PEs On the basis of below-mentioned pointers, Regulatory Body and the Exchanges make their decision of adding a scrip under GSM category:1. Periodic Call Auction Session for Illiquid Securities2. Periodic Review of Movement of Securities to/from Trade for Trade3. Persistent Noise Creators4. Rumour Verification and Clarification in case of Spurt in Price/Volume Every 2 months in the case of ASM and every quarter in the case of GSM, the stock can go in and out of the list based on the review carried out by the exchange.

In case you don\u2019t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list.Alternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form. You can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app Download the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM AppVerify your mobile numberRegister the passcode (it is required to open the app)Select your bank from the options availableThe app will fetch your bank detailsIn case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIMSet up a UPI PIN for securityNow you can check your UPI ID in the profile section. For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed.In case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application. In case you can\u2019t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO.Try to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list. Below are a few things you can do: Go to your Payment App \u2013 Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not.In case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One\u2019s ApplicationORMake sure your Payments App is updated.ORIf it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one\u2019s application and place a new bid. You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app. Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO. With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO. NRI\u2019s can not apply via the Angel One app.However, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank. Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors.This price is ascertained at the allotment stage.When an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price.In an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment. You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor. It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account.You need to check with your bank for more details. You cannot apply via the Angel One app.However, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank. The Angel One app doesn\u2019t allow a minor to apply.Although, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank. As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account.If the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date.Note: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds.If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank . Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order.Please note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid.You will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid.However, if you haven\u2019t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid. Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandateEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected becauseJill\u2019s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of JackJill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN Your funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO.Your funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO.Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date. We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by Applying from only 1 Demat account per PANApplying at cut-off priceEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected because Jill\u2019s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack Jill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.So, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date.Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date. Common reasons why you didn\u2019t get the allotment areNon-Allotment \u2013 Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription Rejection \u2013 Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons:1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price Tax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket. Visit our website https://www.angelone.in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO\u2019s. Your UPI mandate request status on the Angel One app does not get updated in real-time.It will reflect shortly in your IPO order book.

All the market segments, such as Equity (Cash and F&O), Index, Currency, and Commodity are allowed within the basket. Order types available within the basket are: Note \u2013 Please note that GTT orders cannot be placed inside the basket. A maximum of 50 baskets can be created and saved. Also, within each basket, a maximum of 20 securities can be added. No, there is no additional charge for placing a Basket Order. You just have to pay the existing brokerage for the orders in the basket. Basket Orders can be placed only within the market hours i.e., between 9:15 am and 3:15 pm. However, you can create and save the basket anytime during the day. Yes, you can clone your existing baskets. Additionally, you can also clone any order inside the basket. The required margin and the available margin will be shown upfront in the Basket. To give you the margin benefit, the required margin for the entire basket will be calculated using the SPAN calculator. You can add the funds with the \u2018Add Funds\u2019 feature within the Basket to match the required margin. After placing the Basket Order, the status of individual orders will be shown inside the basket. You can take decisions at the individual order level like modifying a pending order or retrying a failed order. If you have saved your basket, then you can see it the next day, but the orders will be reset to the initial state i.e., before placing the Basket Order. However, you won\u2019t be able to see the status of the orders. Please know that if you don\u2019t manually save the basket, it will not appear in the Baskets Tab.

But when you hedge your position in the basket (i.e. combine 2 or more orders), you get the benefit of hedging in terms of lower required margin. You can save time using Basket Order as multiple orders are placed in one click. So, there is no need to place and execute individual orders.

With an already pending stop-loss or exit order, you will need extra funds to be able to place a duplicate SL/exit order. If you do not have this extra fund in your account, then your duplicate exit order will get rejected. That\u2019s why we inform you while exiting if there\u2019s a Pending SL/exit order against a position, to avoid any duplicate orders and rejections. There could be 2 major reasons behind this: Note:In order to increase the chances of execution, we keep the default value of the limit price 2 ticks away from the trigger price. This is done so that if the LTP moves rapidly after triggering the order, the limit price shouldn\u2019t be a hindrance and the order should still get executed. Also, if you change the pre-set limit price and bring it closer to the Trigger Price, the chances of execution can reduce in cases of volatility. Chances are that the market price did hit the stop-loss price, albeit momentarily and without you being able to spot it at that moment. Within a second, prices can change multiple times and not all of them are relayed to the Brokers by Exchange, especially during high volatility. As a result, such momentary price fluctuations are not seen anywhere.Price matching and execution of the orders\u00a0 is done by the Exchanges and not the Broker. Stop-loss is a tool that investors use to minimise the loss in a trade. Some traders define it as an advance order, which triggers an automatic closure of an open position when the stock price reaches the trigger price level.Stop loss helps minimise losses but also limit profits from a trade. A Trailing Stop-loss is an order that lets you set a maximum value or percentage of loss you can incur on a trade. If the securiy price rises or falls in your favour, the trigger price jumps with it at the set value or percentage. If the security price rises or falls against you, the trigger price stays in place depending on the nature of the order. Stop-loss can be your real saviour during a volatile market condition. A price level set at the beginning of the trade allows traders to close their position automatically when the stop-loss is reached. Squaring off takes place at the next price available at the trigger price level and helps limit losses. The 1% rule defines the maximum limit of risk one can take in a trade or the risk-per-trade. It implies adjusting your position so that total loss doesn\u2019t cross 1% of your trade value when the stop-loss is triggered. The 1% rule helps avoid significant losses. You can place a Stop loss order\u00a0 in AngelOne mobile app by following the below simple steps: Our experts will be happy to assist you Still have any queries? Connect with our support team.

In contrast, a Market Order gets executed at the current market price. In the case of Immediate or Cancel (IOC) order, the order has to be executed as soon as it is released in the market.

Let\u2019s say there are 100 buyers and 50 sellers waiting to trade in ABC at 100. ABC is currently trading at 105 Rs and after a few minutes, it reaches 100 Rs. Since there are only 50 sellers for 100 Rs, only 50 buyers will be able to buy the script once this price is reached.

You invest a lump sum of money at an agreed interest rate and receive the amount along with interest upon maturity. The interest rates are fixed, higher than a regular savings account, and the investment is protected from market fluctuations. Yes, FDs are one of the safest investment options. Unlike market-led investments where returns fluctuate, the returns on an FD are fixed at the time of investment. Even if FD interest rates change over time, your FD will grow at the rate you initially booked. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It insures bank deposits, including savings, current, recurring, and fixed deposits, up to Rs. 5 lakh per account holder per bank. This insurance does not cover FDs with NBFCs. No, fixed deposits are offered by banks, NBFCs, and the India Post Office. FDs with NBFCs, known as Corporate FDs, often offer higher interest rates compared to banks. A Non-Banking Financial Corporation (NBFC) operates as a financial institution without a full banking license, regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Reserve Bank of India. NBFCs offer services like savings, investment plans, lending schemes, insurance, and fixed deposits. You can start investing in fixed deposits with a minimum amount as low as INR 5000. The maximum amount varies based on the specific FD scheme you choose. No, it is not mandatory to add a nominee, but it is recommended. Yes, but you must provide the details of a guardian. You can add any individual as a nominee, including family members, relatives, friends, or any trusted person. Yes, you can add or change a nominee later, but this service is currently available only with some partner banks. You will see the \u201cAdd Nominee\u201d option on the dashboard once your FD is successfully booked. FD advice is a computer-generated statement provided by the bank as proof of ownership or investment when you open a fixed deposit. Currently, we do not offer a solution to avoid TDS deduction. Some banks allow the filing of forms 15G/15H, but we do not have this functionality. TDS is deducted only if the total interest from all sources with the bank exceeds Rs 40,000 for normal citizens and Rs 50,000 for senior citizens. Interest earnings from your fixed deposit are taxed according to your tax slab. For example, if you are in the 20% tax bracket and you earned Rs 6,000 interest from a 1-year FD of Rs 1 lakh at 6%, you will pay 20% of Rs 6,000, which is Rs 1,200, as tax.

Surveillance Measure is an initative by the regulatory bodies and exchanges to protect traders and investors by monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities like insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more. SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) along with the stock exchanges have initiated an Additional Surveillance Measure or ASM to safeguard investors\u2019 interests by ensuring there are no market speculations or manipulations like unexpected price movements. The stocks are categorized under ASM for surveillance based on criteria specified by NSEhere. GSM or Graded Surveillance Measure is a system used by Indian Stock Exchanges like NSE and BSE to alert traders/investors and ask them to be extra cautious while dealing in certain securities which have been categorized under GSM. Scrips can be classified under GSM due to abnormal price hike that doesn\u2019t match with the company\u2019s financial health, are illiquid, have negligible market capital, and are underpreforming. The main aim of the ASM framework is to control stock volatility, while the primary objective of GSM is to protect the investors from underperforming stocks by not allowing intraday trading and to advise them to be extra vigilant while dealing with securities that are witnessing unusual price fluctuations. Both these frameworks are introduced with different objectives, but their main goal is to protect traders and investors. SEBI and Exchanges jointly decides the objective criterion to shortlist securities under ASM based on the following parameters:1. High Low Variation2. Client Concentration3. Close to Close Price Variation4. Market Capitalization5. Volume Variation6. Delivery Percentage7. No. of Unique PANs & PEs On the basis of below-mentioned pointers, Regulatory Body and the Exchanges make their decision of adding a scrip under GSM category:1. Periodic Call Auction Session for Illiquid Securities2. Periodic Review of Movement of Securities to/from Trade for Trade3. Persistent Noise Creators4. Rumour Verification and Clarification in case of Spurt in Price/Volume Every 2 months in the case of ASM and every quarter in the case of GSM, the stock can go in and out of the list based on the review carried out by the exchange.

For successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry.

In case you don\u2019t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list.Alternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form. You can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app Download the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM AppVerify your mobile numberRegister the passcode (it is required to open the app)Select your bank from the options availableThe app will fetch your bank detailsIn case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIMSet up a UPI PIN for securityNow you can check your UPI ID in the profile section. For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed.In case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application. In case you can\u2019t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO.Try to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list. Below are a few things you can do: Go to your Payment App \u2013 Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not.In case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One\u2019s ApplicationORMake sure your Payments App is updated.ORIf it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one\u2019s application and place a new bid. You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app. Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO. With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO. NRI\u2019s can not apply via the Angel One app.However, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank. Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors.This price is ascertained at the allotment stage.When an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price.In an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment. You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor. It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account.You need to check with your bank for more details. You cannot apply via the Angel One app.However, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank. The Angel One app doesn\u2019t allow a minor to apply.Although, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank. As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account.If the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date.Note: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds.If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank . Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order.Please note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid.You will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid.However, if you haven\u2019t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid. Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandateEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected becauseJill\u2019s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of JackJill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN Your funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO.Your funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO.Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date. We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by Applying from only 1 Demat account per PANApplying at cut-off priceEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected because Jill\u2019s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack Jill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.So, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date.Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date. Common reasons why you didn\u2019t get the allotment areNon-Allotment \u2013 Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription Rejection \u2013 Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons:1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price Tax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket.
